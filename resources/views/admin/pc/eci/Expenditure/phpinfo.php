I am taking the mpdf/mpdf and niklasravnsborg/laravel-pdf installed version from system admin for demo server ,which are below

"mpdf/mpdf": "^7.x-dev",
"niklasravnsborg/laravel-pdf": "^3.1.0",
 
screen shot also attched.

As see your provided code for pdf had been used other than mpdf/mpdf library for generating pdf report.kindly provide me your already running mpdf/mpdf code on demo server because my code is running fine on live server as welll as my local pc.
